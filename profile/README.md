# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 

Here you will find our core Chess Centre repositories, all open for contributions or reuse / purpose!

Our mission is to continually improve and advance the features available to players and organisers looking to play / host over-the-board chess events.

The primary production application is: 

*  [**platform**](https://github.com/chess-centre/platform) - a members based event sign-up application including automatic rating tracking, game storage and insights.

Additional projects are now actively in development:

* [**broadcast**](https://github.com/chess-centre/broadcasts) _(very early beta)_ - a DGT board presentation tool for easily showcasing event results with live chess data

* [**league**](https://github.com/chess-centre/leagues) _(in active development)_ - a league management tool for presentating detailed local / national chess league information

* [**events**](https://github.com/chess-centre/events) _(in planning)_ - a UK chess events calendar, designed for easily publishing and finding local chess events

The goal is to make these as user-friendly as possible including with supporting tools & utilities for organisers to submit information quickly and easily.
