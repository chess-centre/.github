# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 

See below our core Chess Centre repositories, all open for contributions!

Our mission is to continually improve and advance the features available to players and organisers looking to play / host over-the-board events.

The primary production application is: 

*  **platform** - a members based event sign up application including automatic rating tracking

Additional projects are now actively in development:

* **broadcast** (beta) - a DGT board presentation tool for easily showcasing event results with live chess data

* **league** (tbc) - a league management tool for presentating detailed local / national chess league information

* **events** (tbc) - a UK chess events calendar, designed for easily publishing and finding local chess events

The goal is to make these as user-friendly as possible including the supporting tools & utilities for organisers to submit information quickly and easily.
